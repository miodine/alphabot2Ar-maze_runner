# About
The aim of the project was to adapt the AlphaBot2-Ar platform for the purposes of maze traversing. The
adaptation concerned both the hardware modifications (additional sensors and pin reconfiguration) and the
development of purpose-specific software (robot control routines). Project completion involved construction of
the maze as well, on which we could test the platform. The conceptual assumptions regarding the wheeled
platform - modify it in such a way, that would render it capable of left-hand side wall following, detection of
intersections and movement trajectory compensation
